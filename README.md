Our (@kayak23 and @rafmillan) contribution to this project consists of the implementation
of /libfs/fs.c, the files in /apps/test_files/, and the following tests: /apps/tests.x, 
/apps/test_write.c, /apps/test_read.c, /apps/setup.x. All other files were provided to us
for the assignment by Professor Joel Porquet-Lupine (@joel-porquet).
